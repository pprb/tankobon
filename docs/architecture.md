# Architecture

Tankōbon is an Electron app (Vite + Electron Forge) for managing and reading digital comics (CBZ, CBR, PDF). This page is hand-written: it explains *why* the code is shaped the way it is. The *what* (signatures, types, IPC channels, database schema) is generated from the code, under [Reference](./reference/api/index.md). Structural decisions are recorded as [ADRs](./decisions/index.md).

## Processes and boundaries

The app follows the standard Electron three-process split, with a strict boundary: `src/main.ts` creates the window with `contextIsolation: true`, `nodeIntegration: false` and `sandbox: true` (see [ADR 0001](./decisions/0001-electron-process-isolation.md)).

| Layer | Files | Role |
|---|---|---|
| Main process | `src/main.ts`, `src/main/` | Owns the window, the SQLite database and all filesystem/archive access. |
| Preload | `src/preload.ts` | The *only* bridge between renderer and main. Exposes a single `window.tankobon` object via `contextBridge`. |
| Renderer | `src/renderer.tsx`, `src/routes/`, `src/hooks/`, `src/components/`, `src/lib/` | React 19 UI; talks to main exclusively through `window.tankobon`. |
| Shared types | `src/shared/` | Types used on both sides of the IPC boundary (`ComicInfo`, `LibraryEntry`, `AppSettings`…). |

The window is also locked to the app's own page: `src/main.ts` cancels `will-navigate` to any other URL and denies every `window.open`/middle-click new window, and `src/renderer.tsx` cancels the default of `dragover`/`drop` on the document (the components' own drop handlers still run), so dropping a PDF or an HTML file on the window can't replace the UI. The CSP in `index.html` adds `base-uri 'none'`, `form-action 'none'` and `object-src 'none'`.

`src/main.ts` opens the database once, builds the repositories and the thumbnail cache, registers the IPC handlers of `src/main/ipc/*.ts`, then creates the window.

### IPC channels

Channel-name constants (e.g. `COMIC_CHANNELS`, `LIBRARY_CHANNELS`) live in the main-process IPC files, but the preload can't import them (different process and build target), so the strings are duplicated in `src/preload.ts`. Both sides must be kept in sync by hand; `npm run docs:gen` fails if they diverge, and generates the [IPC reference](./reference/ipc.md).

The shape of `window.tankobon` is declared up front as explicit interfaces (`TankobonApi`, then one per namespace: `ComicApi`, `LibraryApi`…), and the `api` object only implements them. The method descriptions live on those interfaces, once: TypeDoc renders them as the [API reference](./reference/api/preload/interfaces/TankobonApi.md), and `npm run docs:gen` reads the same comments for the IPC reference's description column. A new method needs its signature and TSDoc in the interface, then its implementation in `api`.

Everything is `invoke`/`handle` (request/response), except `library:scan-progress`, the one main → renderer push channel (see [Folder scanning](#folder-scanning)).

The "À propos" section gets the app's version (`app.getVersion()`, main process only) and the runtime versions from `app:get-info`, as an `AppInfo` (`src/shared/app.ts`). Its links go through `app:open-link`, which takes a key of `APP_LINKS` (repository, documentation, releases, issues), never a URL: the main process only ever passes those fixed pages to `shell.openExternal`, so a compromised renderer can't make it open anything else.

The `app:get-system-languages` channel returns the OS's preferred languages, so the renderer resolves the `system` language setting against the same list as the main process (see [Interface language](#interface-language)).

Errors that the user should see come back as a `{ status: 'error', message }` member of a result union (`ImportResult`, `DatabaseLocationResult`, `MetadataSearchResult`, `ReadingListResult`) rather than as a thrown error: an `ipcMain.handle` rejection reaches the renderer wrapped in "Error invoking remote method …".

`ArchiveInfo` is what `ComicService` knows about an opened archive before it's matched to a library entry; the `comic:open` handler (`src/main/ipc/comic.ts`) merges it with the library entry to produce the `ComicInfo` sent to the renderer.

## Interface language

The UI is translated with [i18next](https://www.i18next.com/) (and `react-i18next` in the renderer), in English and French ([ADR 0008](./decisions/0008-interface-translations-i18next.md)).

- **One module, one instance per process**: `src/shared/i18n.ts` creates an i18next instance loaded synchronously with every locale (they are bundled: nothing is fetched, `t()` works from the first line). The main process and the renderer each get their own copy of the module, hence their own instance, switched by `applyLanguage()`. It starts in English (`FALLBACK_LANGUAGE`), which is also what a string missing from a locale falls back to.
- **Locales split by area**: `src/locales/<language>/<namespace>.ts`, one namespace per area of the app (`library`, `lists`, `reader`, `settings`, `metadata`, `bookEdit`, `book` for field and role labels, `nav`, `common`, and the main process's `errors` and `dialogs`), gathered by `src/locales/<language>/index.ts`. Keys are typed (`CustomTypeOptions`, from the English locale): a mistyped key fails `npm run typecheck`. Each French namespace is typed `Translation<typeof en>` (`src/locales/types.ts`), so a key missing from or added to one locale only fails too; `i18n.test.ts` also checks that both locales use the same `{{variables}}`. Plurals use i18next's `_one`/`_other` suffixes with a `count`, so French and English each get their own rule (French singular for 0 and 1).
- **Which language**: `AppSettings.language` is `system` (the default) or a supported language. `resolveLanguage()` (pure, tested) returns the forced language, else the first of the OS's preferred languages whose base (`fr` in `fr-CA`) is supported, else English; an unsupported stored value counts as `system`, and the import turns it back into `system`. The main process applies it at start-up and whenever the setting is written or imported (`applyMainLanguage()`, `src/main/language.ts`, with `app.getPreferredSystemLanguages()`). The renderer applies it before its first render, from the settings and the same OS list (`app:get-system-languages`), then on each change through `useSettings().update` and `reload()` (`applyInterfaceLanguage()`, which also sets `<html lang>`); components using `useTranslation()` re-render on their own.
- **Messages from the main process** (result-union errors, rejected IPC calls, native dialog titles) are translated there, in the language last applied, so the renderer shows them as they come.
- **Formatting** follows the current language: file sizes (`formatFileSize()`: units and decimal separator), language names (`formatLanguage()`, through `Intl.DisplayNames`), tag sorting. Pure helpers in `src/lib/` call `t()` directly rather than taking it as a parameter; their tests switch the language with `applyLanguage()`, and the main-process tests that check user-facing messages run in French.
- **Data stays untranslated**: what the user stores is never translated. The quick tags are stored as `Lu`/`À lire` in every language (`READ_TAG`, `TO_READ_TAG`; `isFinished()` relies on `Lu`), and only shown through `tagLabel()`.

## Local database (`src/main/db/`)

Persistence uses Node's built-in `node:sqlite` (`DatabaseSync`): no native module to compile, and nothing stored in the cloud or in Chromium's `localStorage`/IndexedDB ([ADR 0002](./decisions/0002-local-storage-node-sqlite.md)). The generated [schema reference](./reference/schema.md) lists the tables and columns.

- **Repositories take a `DatabaseSync` in their constructor** instead of opening it themselves, which makes them testable with `new DatabaseSync(':memory:')` without touching Electron (`app.getPath`).
- **Migrations**: `migrate()` in `schema.ts` uses `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` for tables; columns added after the initial release (`file_count`, `file_size`, `rating`, `tags`, then `title_locked`, `series`, `volume`, `release_date`, `language`, and `reading_lists.position`) go through `addColumnIfMissing()`, which checks `PRAGMA table_info` before an `ALTER TABLE … ADD COLUMN`. Existing installed databases pick them up without a destructive migration. A new column must follow the same pattern.
- **Transactions**: `withTransaction(db, fn)` (`transaction.ts`) wraps `BEGIN`/`COMMIT`/`ROLLBACK` around `fn`. Every write that spans several statements uses it (`LibraryRepository`'s `upsert`, `setCredits` and `remove`; `ReadingListRepository`'s `upsert`, `reorderLists`, `removeEntry`, `remove` and the position writes), so an interrupted `remove()` can't leave orphan credits. Calls nest: inside an open transaction (`db.isTransaction`) `fn` just joins it, and only the outermost call commits or rolls back. `applyImport()` takes the `DatabaseSync` for that reason: the whole JSON import is one transaction, so a failure midway leaves the database untouched, and it avoids one disk commit per statement (about 7.6 s for 2 000 books, 0.2 s in a transaction).
- **Tests run the real schema**: `schema.ts` holds `migrate()` on its own, away from `database.ts` (which imports `electron`), so the repository tests (`*.test.ts` in `src/main/db/`) build their `:memory:` databases with the same `migrate()` as the app, and can't drift from it. `schema.test.ts` covers a fresh database and the upgrade of one from the initial release.

### Library (`library-repository.ts`)

One row per comic ever opened or scanned. Three writers, with deliberately different rules:

| Method | Used by | Existing entry | `rating`/`tags`, looked-up metadata, credits |
|---|---|---|---|
| `touch()` | `comic:open` | Refreshes title (unless `title_locked`), page count, file count/size, bumps `last_opened_at`, clamps `current_page` if the page count shrank | Never touched |
| `register()` | folder scan | Left completely alone (a scan is not a read) | Never touched |
| `upsert()` | JSON import | Overwritten with the snapshot's values | Overwritten (restoring a backup is what the user asked for) |

`updateRating()`/`updateTags()`/`updateProgress()`/`updateMetadata()` are the dedicated writers for user-set fields.

- `updateMetadata()` writes only the fields present in its `MetadataUpdate` (the ones the user accepted in the lookup dialog). Writing a `title` sets `title_locked`, which makes `touch()` keep it instead of putting the file name back; `comic:open` returns the library title, so the reader header shows it too.

- The manual edit form ("Modifier la fiche", `BookEditDialog` in `src/components/book-edit-dialog.tsx`) writes through the same `updateMetadata()`, with no lookup involved. Its logic is pure (`src/lib/book-edit.ts`): `validateForm()` refuses an empty title, a release date that isn't a real `YYYY`/`YYYY-MM`/`YYYY-MM-DD`, and a credit with a first name but no last name; `formToUpdate()` keeps only the fields that differ from the entry (so saving an untouched form locks nothing) and, unlike a lookup's review, compares names exactly. Since `people` matches names with `COLLATE NOCASE`, a case-only rename finds the existing person and keeps its spelling.

- `fileCount` is the archive's total entry count (all files, not just image pages); `fileSize` is the file's size on disk, computed with `fs.stat` in the IPC layer, not in `ComicArchive`.
- `tags` is a JSON-encoded `string[]` column: no normalized tags table, a personal library doesn't need one.
- **People and credits** are normalized, unlike tags, because people are meant to get their own page later (nationality, notes): `people` holds each person once, unique on (`first_name`, `last_name`) with `COLLATE NOCASE`; `credits` links a library entry, a person and a `CreditRole`, with a `position` keeping the source's order. `PeopleRepository.findOrCreate()` matches people by name, so two homonyms would be merged. Credits are always written as a whole list (`setCredits()`, from `updateMetadata()` and `upsert()`); `list()` loads them all in one extra query rather than one per entry. Removing an entry deletes its credits explicitly (on top of the `ON DELETE CASCADE`) and keeps its people.
- `volume` is `TEXT`, not a number: issue numbers can be `12.1`, `HS`, `1/2`. `release_date` keeps whatever precision the source has (`YYYY`, `YYYY-MM` or `YYYY-MM-DD`).
- `lastOpenedPath()` feeds the open dialog's `defaultPath` (`src/main/ipc/comic.ts`), falling back to the OS default when there is no history or that directory no longer exists.

### Reading lists (`reading-list-repository.ts`)

`reading_lists` holds each list (`id`, `name`, `created_at`, and its `position` among the lists); `reading_list_items` links a list to library entries with a `position`, unique per (list, entry). A list holds at most `MAX_READING_LIST_SIZE` (50) books, enforced by `addEntry()`. Refusals (full list, empty name, unknown list, stale order) come back as a `ReadingListResult` error.

- **Order of the lists**: `list()` sorts on `position`, then `created_at`. A new list (`create()`, or a new one from `upsert()`) goes after `MAX(position)`; lists created before the column existed all share `position = 0`, so they keep their creation order until the first reorder. The sidebar's drag and drop (`ReadingListsNav` in `src/routes/__root.tsx`, through the pure `moveItem()`) sends the whole new order to `reorderLists()`, which, like `reorder()` for books, refuses an order that doesn't hold exactly the current lists (`ReadingListOrderResult`). The import applies the snapshot's order (its lists first, then the local-only ones), the export's `readingLists` being in `list()` order.

- **Adding from the library by drag and drop**: the library page's rows (cover and text only, so the stars, buttons and tag field keep their mouse handling) carry the book under the custom `LIBRARY_ENTRY_DRAG_TYPE` (`src/lib/reading-list.ts`). `ReadingListsNav` only accepts a drop on a list when the drag holds that type, which tells it from one of its own lists being reordered and from files dragged in from outside; it calls `addEntry()` (already in the list is a no-op there) and shows `dropFeedback()`'s message under the lists for a few seconds.

- **"Finished" is derived, never stored**: `isFinished()` (`src/lib/reading-list.ts`) is true once the last page was reached or the entry carries the `Lu` tag. A list's progress, its next book (`nextToRead()`) and the greyed-out rows are all computed in the renderer from the `library:list` entries, so they can't drift from the reading progress.
- **Reordering rule**: finished books are pinned. `moveUnfinished()` only swaps unfinished books among the slots they occupy, each finished book keeping its index; the repository's `reorder()` only checks that the new order holds exactly the list's current entries (a stale order is refused rather than dropping or adding books).
- **Deletions**: like credits, items are deleted explicitly (`LibraryRepository.remove()`, `ReadingListRepository.remove()`), since `PRAGMA foreign_keys` is off and the `ON DELETE CASCADE` doesn't apply. Removing a library entry leaves a gap in the positions, which is why `addEntry()` appends after `MAX(position)` rather than at the list's length.
- **Next book in the reader**: the list pages open the reader with a `list` search param; `useNextInList()` then finds the list's first unfinished book other than the current one (whose progress may not be saved yet), shown on the last page. It shows nothing when the current book isn't in that list (another file opened from the reader).

### Settings (`settings-repository.ts`)

A generic key/value store (JSON-encoded values) for `AppSettings`, merged with `DEFAULT_SETTINGS` on read, so a new setting key needs no migration.

### Database location (`db-location.ts`)

The location can't be an `AppSettings` entry, since the settings are stored *in* the database. It is a tiny `db-location.json` pointer file that always stays in `userData` ([ADR 0003](./decisions/0003-database-location-pointer-file.md)).

- A missing or malformed pointer silently falls back to `userData` rather than throwing, so a hand-edited (or sync-mangled) file can't stop the app from starting.
- The functions are pure (they take the `userData` path, never call `app.getPath`), which makes them testable; `database.ts` is the only bridge to Electron.
- Changing the location only rewrites the pointer: the existing file is *not* moved, because pointing at a directory that already holds a `tankobon.db` (a synced folder, another machine) must keep that database. The open database stays open until the next start (`database:relaunch`).

### Export / import (`export-service.ts`, `import-service.ts`)

- `buildExport()` snapshots library, reading lists and settings as `{ version: 1, exportedAt, library, readingLists, settings }`, written by `data:export` through a save dialog, whose default file name (`exportFileName()`) carries the local date and time. The library entries carry their looked-up metadata and credits; reading lists reference their books by **path**. The format stays `version: 1`, since those fields are only additions (an older export comes back with them empty). The settings include the metadata API keys.
- `parseExport()` validates a user-picked file: anything that isn't a `version: 1` export is rejected; broken library entries are dropped, as are credits without a last name or with an unknown role; only known settings keys whose value type matches the default are kept. An export is a file the user can edit, so nothing in it is trusted.
- `applyImport()` merges it: entries match on **path**, not id (ids aren't stable across machines); the snapshot wins for the entries it contains; entries only present locally are untouched; settings are replaced wholesale. Reading lists match on **id** (random UUIDs, so the same list keeps its id on every machine) and are replaced by the snapshot's; their paths are resolved to the local entries after the library is merged, and a path with no entry is dropped.
- Cover thumbnails are not exported: after `applyImport()`, `data:import` starts `ThumbnailCache.rebuild()` in the background (see [Cover thumbnails](#cover-thumbnails)) and returns without waiting for it.
- **Clearing the library** (`data:clear-library`): `ReadingListRepository.clear()` deletes every list, then `LibraryRepository.clear()` empties `library`, `credits`, `people` and `reading_list_items` (people only exist through credits, so none would be left referenced); `ThumbnailCache.prune([])` then deletes every thumbnail. Settings, the database location and the files on disk are left alone. The renderer asks for confirmation, showing the counts from `library:list` and `reading-lists:list`, then calls `notifyReadingListsChanged()` so the sidebar drops the deleted lists.

## Comic archives (`src/main/services/`)

`ComicArchive` (`comic-archive.ts`) is the format-agnostic interface (`pages`, `fileCount`, `readPage()`, `close()`), implemented by `CbzArchive` (`node-stream-zip`), `CbrArchive` (`node-unrar-js`) and `PdfArchive` (`pdfjs-dist`).

- `fileCount` counts every non-directory entry; `pages` is filtered and naturally sorted down to image entries (hidden files and `__MACOSX/` resource forks excluded). They commonly differ (a `ComicInfo.xml` sidecar counts in `fileCount`); for PDFs they are always equal.
- `openArchive()` (`comic-service.ts`) picks the implementation from the file extension.
- `ComicService` keeps opened archives alive between IPC calls, addressed by an opaque `randomUUID()`, distinct from the persistent library id.

### CBZ: closing while reading

`CbzArchive.close()` waits for in-flight `readPage()` calls to settle before closing the zip, and `readPage()` refuses to start once closing has begun. `node-stream-zip` closes its file descriptor immediately, and a read caught mid-way fails with `EBADF` on an internal stream whose error never reaches the `entryData()` promise: it becomes an *uncaught exception in the main process*. This happens routinely from the renderer (switching books while a page loads, leaving continuous mode while preloads run); see `cbz-archive.test.ts`.

### CBR: the wasm file

`node-unrar-js`'s Emscripten glue locates its `.wasm` relative to its own `__dirname`, which breaks once Vite bundles it into `main.cjs`. `vite.main.config.mts` copies `unrar.wasm` next to the bundle (`vite-plugin-static-copy`), and `cbr-archive.ts` reads it itself and passes it as `wasmBinary`. A CBR is read fully into memory when opened.

### CBR: one wasm module for every archive

All `node-unrar-js` extractors share a single wasm module, and each `createExtractorFromData()` points that module at the extractor just created. An extractor kept from `open()` and reused later would, once another CBR has been opened (a second book, a folder scan), read the *other* archive's bytes: `File is not RAR archive`, then a `TypeError` in `getFiles`. So `CbrArchive` keeps only the file's bytes, and every operation (`open()`'s listing, each `readPage()`) creates a fresh extractor and drains it synchronously, through a module-level queue so that no other creation can slip in between; see `cbr-archive.test.ts`.

### PDF rendering

See [ADR 0004](./decisions/0004-pdf-rendering-pdfjs-napi-canvas.md). `PdfArchive` rasterizes each page on demand at a fixed `RENDER_SCALE` of 200/72 (~200 DPI) through `pdfjs-dist`'s `legacy` build, returning PNG bytes.

- **Page size ceiling**: a PDF can declare a page of thousands of points per side in a few hundred bytes, and the continuous mode renders several pages at once. `pageRenderScale()` therefore lowers the scale below `RENDER_SCALE` so that a page never exceeds `MAX_PAGE_PIXELS` (40 megapixels), computed from the page's size at scale 1. Likewise `CbzArchive.readPage()` refuses an entry whose declared size is above `MAX_ENTRY_SIZE` (200 MB) with a translated error.
- pdf.js references `DOMMatrix`/`Path2D`/`ImageData`/`Image` as bare globals; `pdf-archive.ts` installs `@napi-rs/canvas`'s implementations on `globalThis` once.
- `page.render()` is given the `canvas` object itself, not just a `canvasContext`.
- `pdfjs-dist`'s package directory is found with the plain CommonJS `require.resolve('pdfjs-dist/package.json')`, **not** `createRequire(import.meta.url)`: the main bundle is CommonJS, where Rollup rewrites `import.meta.url` to `undefined`, which would crash at module load time (the app would not start at all).

### Cover thumbnails

See [ADR 0007](./decisions/0007-cover-thumbnails-disk-cache.md). `ThumbnailCache` (`thumbnail-cache.ts`) keeps a WebP of each book's first page, shrunk by `renderThumbnail()` (`@napi-rs/canvas`) to fit in 240 × 360 px, as a file in `<userData>/thumbnails/` named after a hash of the book's path (`thumbnailKey()`). It is a pure cache: nothing in the database points at it, it stays in `userData` even when the database is moved, and any missing file is regenerated.

- **Writers**: the folder scan, through `scanIntoLibrary()`'s `onAdded` hook, from the archive it already has open (`storeFromArchive()`); `comic:open`, in the background, from the reader's archive (`ensure(path, readFirstPage)`), so opening a book never waits for its cover; `library:thumbnail`, on demand, opening the file itself when the thumbnail is missing; `rebuild()` after a JSON import.
- **One queue**: every generation (and `prune()`) is serialized through a promise chain, one book at a time, so a library page asking for hundreds of covers or a rebuild never opens archives in parallel; concurrent requests for the same book share one generation. `rebuild()` awaits each book in turn, so the library page's requests interleave with it instead of waiting for the end.
- A file that couldn't be opened is remembered for the session (until the next `rebuild()`), so a missing file isn't reopened every time the library is shown. A failure of a given page reader (the reader closed the book meanwhile) is not remembered.
- Files are written aside then renamed. `prune()` deletes everything that isn't the thumbnail of a library book, temporary files included; it runs at start-up, in `rebuild()` and, with an empty list, when the library is cleared. `library:remove` deletes the book's thumbnail.
- **Renderer side**: `BookCover` (`src/components/book-cover.tsx`) asks `library.thumbnail(id)` only once its row comes within 400 px of the viewport, and shows the bytes through a `blob:` URL (allowed by the CSP's `img-src`), revoked on unmount.

## Metadata lookup (`src/main/services/metadata-service.ts`)

The "Rechercher les infos" action of the library looks a book up in public APIs ([ADR 0005](./decisions/0005-metadata-lookup-public-apis.md)). The requests are made by the main process (`metadata:search`, `src/main/ipc/metadata.ts`), never by the renderer: the API keys stay out of the renderer, there is no CORS to deal with, and the renderer's CSP (`index.html`) still allows no connection beyond `'self'`.

- `searchMetadata()` queries the enabled sources in parallel (`ComicVineClient` only when it has an API key, `GoogleBooksClient` always when enabled) and normalizes their results to `MetadataCandidate`. A failing source adds its message (in the interface language) to `errors` next to the other source's results; `status: 'error'` is only for nothing configured, an empty query, or every source failing. `rankCandidates()` puts the candidates matching the requested volume first.
- **Comic Vine** (`comic-vine.ts`): with a volume number, it searches the series (`resources=volume`) then that issue number in the top 3 series (`/issues/?filter=volume:…,issue_number:…`), else (or when that finds nothing) runs a plain issue search. The search results don't include credits, so each of the (at most 5) issues gets a detail request. All requests are sequential, since Comic Vine flags bursts. Its role names map to `CreditRole` (`penciler` → `artist`; `editor` is dropped). It needs a non-generic `User-Agent`, hence `Tankobon/<version>`.
- **Google Books** (`google-books.ts`): one full-text search. It has no series field and doesn't tell writers from artists, so series and volume are read from the title when it spells them out (`splitSeriesTitle()`), and every author gets the generic `author` role.
- **Bédéthèque** (`bedetheque.ts`, [ADR 0006](./decisions/0006-bedetheque-album-page-scraping.md)): not a search source. A pasted album-page link (`isBedethequeAlbumUrl()`, `src/shared/metadata.ts`) goes through `metadata:from-page` → `fetchMetadataPage()`, which downloads the page and parses only its main album block (`<section class="bdt-ah">`) with regular expressions: series from the `<h1>`, number and title from the `bdt-ah-sub` subtitle, credits from `liste-auteurs` (role labels mapped to `CreditRole`, placeholders such as `<N&B>` dropped), the legal deposit as release date (the exact day only when the page spells it out, since its `datePublished` meta pads an unknown day with `01`). Placeholders carry raw `<`/`>` in their `title` attribute, so tag patterns skip quoted attribute values as a whole.
- `http-json.ts` holds the network helpers: a JSON GET (`getJson()`) and an HTML GET (`getHtml()`), with a timeout and `"<Source>: …"` errors in the interface language (unreachable, timeout, exhausted quota, missing page, the API's own message). The IPC layer passes it Electron's `net.fetch`, which goes through Chromium's network stack and honours the system proxy; tests pass a fake `fetch`.
- The pure text helpers are shared with the renderer (`src/shared/title-parsing.ts`): `guessQueryFromTitle()` prefills the dialog's search from a file name (bracketed tags dropped, volume from "T03"/"Vol. 2"/"#12" or a standalone 1–3 digit number, so a bare year isn't taken for a volume), `splitPersonName()` turns "Jean Van Hamme" into first/last name (particles stay with the last name, a single word is a last name).
- **Renderer side**: `MetadataDialog` (`src/components/metadata-dialog.tsx`) runs search → pick a candidate → review → `library.updateMetadata()`; a Bédéthèque link in the search field calls `metadata.fromPage()` instead and goes straight to the review. The review logic is pure (`src/lib/metadata-review.ts`): `buildReview()` lists only the fields the candidate knows, pre-accepted when they'd change something, plus the current credits (kept) and the candidate's new ones (added); `reviewToUpdate()` turns the accepted rows into a `MetadataUpdate` (an emptied field is cleared, an emptied title is ignored, credits become exactly the accepted rows). Cover thumbnails are loaded straight from the sources, which is why the CSP in `index.html` allows `img-src` from `comicvine.gamespot.com`, `books.google.com` and `www.bedetheque.com` (and nothing else).

## Build gotchas

These are the non-obvious constraints of the main-process bundle. Breaking one usually doesn't fail the build, only the packaged app.

| Constraint | Where | What breaks otherwise |
|---|---|---|
| `package.json`'s `main` is `.vite/build/main.cjs`, and `src/main.ts` loads `preload.cjs` | `package.json`, `src/main.ts` | Forge 8's Vite plugin emits the main and preload bundles as `.cjs`: `electron-forge package` refuses a `main` ending in `.js`, and a stale preload path leaves `window.tankobon` undefined. |
| `node:sqlite` listed in `build.rollupOptions.external` | `vite.main.config.mts` | It isn't in Node's `builtinModules` yet, so Vite bundles an empty stub: `DatabaseSync` is silently `undefined` at runtime. |
| `unrar.wasm` copied next to `main.cjs` | `vite.main.config.mts`, `cbr-archive.ts` | CBR files can't be opened. |
| `pdfjs-dist` and `@napi-rs/canvas` external | `vite.main.config.mts` | `@napi-rs/canvas` is a native `.node` binary Rollup can't inline; pdf.js's `legacy` build is a foreign webpack bundle Rollup can't safely re-bundle. Being real packages also ships pdf.js's `standard_fonts`/`cmaps` for free. |
| `hooks.packageAfterCopy` copies `pdfjs-dist`, `@napi-rs/canvas` and the installed `@napi-rs/canvas-<platform>-<arch>` | `forge.config.ts` | The Forge Vite plugin only packages its build output plus `package.json`, never `node_modules`: PDFs fail in the packaged app. Only the platform package matching the machine that ran `npm install` exists, so a package must be built on its target platform. |
| `AutoUnpackNativesPlugin` | `forge.config.ts` | The native binary would stay inside the asar archive, which can't be `dlopen`ed. |
| `packagerConfig.executableName` is `tankobon` on Linux | `forge.config.ts` | Packager names the Linux binary after `productName` (`Tankōbon`), while the deb and rpm makers look for `name` (`tankobon`): `npm run make` fails on Linux with "could not find the Electron app binary". |

## Renderer

### Routing (`src/routes/`)

File-based routes via TanStack Router, with an in-memory history (`createMemoryHistory` in `src/renderer.tsx`). `src/routeTree.gen.ts` is generated by `@tanstack/router-plugin` on `npm start`/build: never edit it by hand. It is committed, because `npm run typecheck` (and CI) need it without running Vite. `validateSearch` on a route needs no manual wiring in it. The reader route (`/reader`) accepts an optional `path` search param, used by the library page to open a specific file, and an optional `list` (a reading-list id, see [Reading lists](#reading-lists-reading-list-repository-ts)). The reading lists are `/lists` (`lists/index.tsx`) and `/lists/$listId` (`lists/$listId.tsx`, which sets `remountDeps` on its params: the router would otherwise keep the page mounted when only the list changes, and a rename in progress would be applied to the newly selected list).

### Settings sections

`src/routes/settings.tsx` is a layout route (title + `<Outlet/>`); `settings/reading.tsx`, `settings/appearance.tsx`, `settings/metadata.tsx` (lookup sources and API keys), `settings/data.tsx` and `settings/about.tsx` ("À propos") are the sections; `settings/index.tsx` only `redirect`s to the first one. The section list is `SETTINGS_SECTIONS` (`src/lib/settings-nav.ts`), shared with the sidebar so the two can't drift. Adding a section means a file in `src/routes/settings/`, a line in `SETTINGS_SECTIONS` and its label under `settings:sections` in both locales. `settings/appearance.tsx` also holds the interface language picker.

In the sidebar (`src/routes/__root.tsx`), `SettingsNav` unfolds those sections: clicking "Paramètres" while folded unfolds *and* navigates; while unfolded it only folds (it `preventDefault()`s the `Link`). The unfolded state is transient component state. `ReadingListsNav` does the same for the reading lists, with one difference: `/lists` is a real page, so its label always navigates (and unfolds) and only the separate chevron button folds. Its lists come from `useReadingLists()` (`src/hooks/use-reading-lists.ts`), which reloads whenever `notifyReadingListsChanged()` is called; every view that creates, renames, deletes or reorders a list (and the data import) calls it, so the sidebar never shows a stale name; the `/lists` page, which loads the lists along with the library, listens to the same signal through `onReadingListsChanged()`. `AppSettings.sidebarCollapsed` (a persisted setting) switches the whole sidebar to an icon-only rail, which hides the sub-entries.

### Library search & filters (`src/lib/library-filter.ts`)

The whole library comes from a single `library:list` call and is filtered client-side; a personal collection is small, so there is no SQL-side filtering. The logic is pure (unit-tested under Vitest's `node` environment, no DOM):

- search matches the title, the file path (so a series folder name finds its albums), the series and the credited people's names, normalized with `NFD` + diacritic stripping ("pokemon" matches "Pokémon");
- read/unread is a **tag** filter: `Lu`/`À lire` are the library page's `QUICK_TAGS`. `availableTags()` keeps them pinned in front even before anything carries them; selecting several tags requires *all* of them;
- the rating filter is a *minimum* (3 stars keeps 3–5).

### Folder scanning

`library:add-folder` opens a directory picker, then `scanIntoLibrary()` (`src/main/services/library-scanner.ts`) walks it recursively for supported files. Unreadable directories are skipped; symlinks are never followed (`Dirent.isDirectory()` is false for them, which also rules out cycles). Learning a page count means opening each file, which is the slow part: progress is pushed file by file over `library:scan-progress`. The renderer subscribes via `library.onScanProgress()` for the whole life of the library page, not around each call, because progress starts as soon as the directory is picked. A file that won't open only counts as `failed`.

Scanned files go through `register()`, never `touch()` (see the table above), and `hasPath()` lets the scanner skip known files without opening them. Each new file's cover thumbnail is cached while its archive is still open (see [Cover thumbnails](#cover-thumbnails)). New rows get `last_opened_at = added_at`, which puts a fresh batch at the top of the list.

### Reader (`src/routes/reader.tsx`)

`AppSettings.readingMode` picks `SinglePageReader` or `ContinuousReader`. They are separate components, each owning its hooks, so switching modes mounts/unmounts cleanly instead of sharing refs and effects.

**Opening and closing.** `useComic` owns the archive's lifetime. `openFile()` isn't cancellable, so each call takes a request number and the hook keeps a mounted flag: a `comic:open` that answers after the reader was left, or after a newer open started, closes the archive it just got (`comic.close(id)`) instead of leaving it in `ComicService` until the app quits (a CBR stays in memory, a CBZ leaks a file descriptor). `useComic({ loadPages: false })` skips the single-page fetch; the reader passes it in continuous mode, which loads its own pages, so the resume page isn't rendered twice (costly for PDFs).

**Reading direction.** `AppSettings.readingDirection` (`ltr`/`rtl`) swaps the two actions bound to the physical controls: `advance` is `next` in LTR and `prev` in RTL, `retreat` the opposite. `useComic`'s `next()`/`prev()` always mean page index ±1. In single-page mode `advance` is bound to `→`, `PageDown`, `Space` and the right click zone; `retreat` to `←`, `PageUp` and the left zone.

**Single page.** Zoom (fit, 50–200 %), optional AI upscaling (below), and wheel-to-turn-page. The wheel only turns the page when there is nothing left to scroll in that direction: always in "fit" zoom, and only at the top/bottom edge when zoomed in. `AppSettings.scrollDirection` (`standard`/`inverted`) decides whether scrolling down calls `advance()` or `retreat()`. `createWheelPager()` (`src/lib/wheel-pager.ts`, pure and unit-tested) collapses one trackpad swipe's many `wheel` events, including macOS's inertia tail, into one page turn: a gesture ends after ~200 ms without events, or when a delta jumps well above the previous one (inertia only decays). The pager is held in `useState`, because the wheel effect re-runs after every page turn (`next`/`prev` change identity each render) and a fresh pager would forget the gesture in progress. Panning events are fed to it too, so a swipe that pans to the edge doesn't turn the page with its leftover inertia.

> Testing note: a JS-dispatched `WheelEvent` fires listeners but does not scroll the element. Verifying real scroll behavior needs CDP's `Input.dispatchMouseEvent` with `type: 'mouseWheel'`.

**AI upscaling.** `useImageUpscaler` (`src/hooks/use-image-upscaler.ts`) runs the page through an ESRGAN model (UpscalerJS on TensorFlow.js) in the renderer, when the page is displayed beyond its native resolution and the user enabled it. The model and TensorFlow.js are loaded with a dynamic `import()` on first use only; the weights are served from the app's own files (`vite.renderer.config.mts` copies them), never from a CDN, so it works offline.

**Continuous scroll.** `ContinuousReader` renders one `ContinuousPage` per page, each with two `IntersectionObserver`s: one with a large `rootMargin` that lazily fetches the page, one with `rootMargin: '-50% 0px -50% 0px'` (a line across the middle of the viewport) that reports the active page: the page crossing that line, since a visibility threshold would never be reached by a page taller than twice the viewport. It reports it for the header and for saving progress (debounced ~400 ms, calling `library.updateProgress` directly, not `useComic`'s `goTo`, which would also start a single-page fetch). A page that fails to load shows "Unreadable page" instead of its spinner. Zoom, upscaling and RTL don't apply; the gap is `AppSettings.pageSpacing` px. On open, `useResumeScroll` scrolls to `comic.resumePage` in a layout effect (before the observers' first callbacks, so page 0 is never reported over the saved progress), then keeps it pinned with a `ResizeObserver` while preloaded pages above change height, until the user's first wheel/pointer/touch/key input. `ContinuousReader` is keyed by `comic.id`, so opening another book remounts it.

**Progress and pace.** `useReadingPace` (`src/hooks/use-reading-pace.ts`) computes the header's "X % · ~Y min" for both modes (`ReadingProgress` component). The pace is for the current session only (nothing persisted): when `sessionKey` (the archive's `comic.id`) changes, it resets by calling `setState` during render (React's "adjust state while rendering" pattern), so the first render of a new book is already right. The estimate stays hidden until `MIN_ELAPSED_MINUTES` has elapsed and at least one page was turned.

**Background.** `AppSettings.readerBackground` (`#rrggbb`, default black) is an inline `backgroundColor` on the page area of both modes; presets are `READER_BACKGROUND_PRESETS` (their names are translated under `settings:appearance.backgrounds`). The header keeps a fixed dark chrome, and page-area placeholders use a mid grey so they stay readable on any background.

**Fullscreen.** `useFullscreen` (`src/hooks/use-fullscreen.ts`) wraps the HTML Fullscreen API on `document.documentElement`: in Electron that makes the window itself fullscreen, and Chromium handles Escape, so no IPC is involved. The reader (`useReaderFullscreen`) toggles it with the header button or `F`/`F11` and exits it when the comic is closed or the route unmounts. While fullscreen, the root layout hides the sidebar (without touching `sidebarCollapsed`) and `ReaderHeader` becomes an overlay shown when the mouse reaches the top edge.
